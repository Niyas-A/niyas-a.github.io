I developed an AI-powered screenshot comparison tool for scalable locale and UI validation, featuring real-time result dashboards. The tool was integrated into CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and connected with GCP, Jira, and Slack for streamlined reporting. Additionally, I created test plans and cases to generate UI screenshots for glucose level alerts in a native iOS app using Swift. This implementation improved testing coverage of system requirements, significantly enhancing validation accuracy and overall product quality.
